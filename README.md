# 7.1: routed anecdotes, step1
Add React Router to the application so that by clicking links in the Menu component the view can be changed.

At the root of the application, meaning the path /, show the list of anecdotes:
![root app](https://fullstackopen.com/static/57c61f000e5eddce42c3a345c2819b77/5a190/40.png)

The Footer component should always be visible at the bottom.

The creation of a new anecdote should happen e.g. in the path create:

# 7.2: routed anecdotes, step2
Implement a view for showing a single anecdote:

![show sinlgle anecdote](https://fullstackopen.com/static/3287ad77ebb90dfac2d734d9801b20b0/5a190/42.png)

Navigating to the page showing the single anecdote is done by clicking the name of that anecdote:
